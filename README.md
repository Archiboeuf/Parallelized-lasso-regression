# Parallelized lasso regression

Project realized as part of a course of *Practical tools for the analysis of big data* at ENSAE. Done in collaboration with a fellow student. (Report and code in French)

We studied an article of Ilya Trofimov and Alexander Genkin (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.6520v1.pdf) explaining how Lasso regression can be parallelized. We implemented what is presented in the article and we compared our results with the Lasso regression provided in the package *scikit-learn* in Python.
